                  A desolate industrial area between West Egg and New York City that represents the moral and social decay hidden 
                  beneath the beautiful faÃ§ade of wealth. It's where the poor suffer for the rich's sins.

                  A faded billboard with giant eyes watching over the Valley of Ashes. They represent God watching the moral corruption 
                  of society or the absence of spiritual values in the materialistic world.

                <p className="text-gray-200 text-sm">
                  His enormous house represents his artificial creation of identity and wealth. It's impressive but lacks genuine 
                  warmth or meaning - beautiful on the outside but ultimately empty.

                  White (Daisy's clothes, her name suggesting flowers) represents false purity and innocence. 
                  Gold symbolizes wealth and corruption - both the promise and the poison of money.

                  The geographic division represents America's social division. East Egg (old money) vs West Egg (new money) shows how class
